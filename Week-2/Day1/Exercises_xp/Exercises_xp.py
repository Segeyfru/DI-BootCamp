# a = 30
# b = 45
# if a > b:
#     print('Hello World!\n a is bigger')
# else:
#     print('Bay-Bay World!(\n b is bigger')

# Exercise 7
# Instructions
# Write code that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.

# user_input = int(input('Write a number: '))
# check = user_input % 2
# # print(check)
# if check == 0:
#     print(f'Number "{user_input}" is EVEN')
# else:
#     print(f'Number "{user_input}" is ODD')

# Exercise 8
# Instructions
# Write code that asks the user for their name and determines whether or not you have the same name, print out a funny message based on the outcome.

# name = 'Sergey'
# user_name = input('What is your name? ').capitalize()
# # print(user_name)
# if name == user_name:

# user_height = int(input('What is your height is centimeters? '))
# if user_height < 145:
#     print('Sorry! You have to grow up some more to ride.')
# elif user_height >= 145:
#     print('Good! You are tall enough to ride.')
